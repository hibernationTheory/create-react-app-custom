/*
Colors

To keep this tidy, all color variable names should be in this format:
  $[Prefix][Luminance Value][Suffix Letter (optional)]

Here's the prefixes you can use:
  blue, brown, gray, green, orange, purple, red, yellow

Get the luminance by converting the hex value to HSL (see http://rgb.to/).
The luminance value is the last percentage.

Only use a suffix letter if there's another color with the same prefix + luminance.

Don't set alpha values here.

Don't add more prefixes. Don't start defining "cyan", and if you need pure black or
pure white, there's already a CSS color variable for that. If you can't decide which
prefix you need (e.g. is this blue or purple?), you're probably not the only one,
so it doesn't matter which one you choose.
